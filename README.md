# Twitter_Integration_And_Segregation
This project hosts codes analyzing twitter diffusion data. 
The codes are used for academic research [Broadcast information diffusion processes on social media networks: exogenous events lead to more integrated public discourse](https://academic.oup.com/joc/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/joc/jqad014/7116308?redirectedFrom=fulltext)

## Open Science Data
The data and files is openly accessible at [OSF](https://osf.io/8fj4r/).

## empirical data analysis
the dir `empirical` contains codes that collect empirical twitter data, construct the dynamic semantic social network, and analyze the integration and segregation metrics of the networks.

## simulation data analysis
the dir `simulation` contains codes that simulate the semantic social network under the influence of broadcast vs. viral diffusion events, and analyze the network metrics.
